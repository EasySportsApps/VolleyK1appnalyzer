## 📝 About VolleyK1@ppnalyzer

VolleyK1@ppnalyzer is a free interactive web application developed with R Studio and Shiny. It is an innovative tool designed to analyze **K1 volleyball (complex 1 or side-out phase)** 🏐 without taking into account the roles or numbers of the players. 

Despite this limitation, it is the **first application in the world** 🌍 that allows the real-time construction of **social networks** to visualize how the game's actions are interrelated spatially in a volleyball team using the 5-1 attack system (5 attackers and 1 setter).

Additionally, it is the first application to enable **real-time calculation of transition probabilities** and **multiple correspondence analysis** for volleyball data. This makes it a unique resource for researchers and sports professionals, providing a comprehensive analysis tool for volleyball. 

## 💡 Future features and ideas for VolleyK1@ppnalyzer

In future versions of VolleyK1@ppnalyzer, we are considering adding the following features:

- **📊 Social network visualization on volleyball court**: visualize the social network graph directly within a volleyball court layout to facilitate the interpretation of the results.
