## <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios-filled/24/000000/document.png"/> About VolleyK1@ppnalyzer

VolleyK1@ppnalyzer is a free and interactive Shiny web app, created and developed by [Raúl Hileno, PhD](https://raulhilenophd-nextlevelstatsandapps4u.netlify.app/), as part of the [EasySportsApps](https://github.com/EasySportsApps) GitHub project. This innovative tool is designed to analyze the **complex 1 or side-out phase (K1) in volleyball matches**, either in person or remotely via YouTube videos.

VolleyK1@ppnalyzer is the world’s first application that enables real-time construction of **social network graphs**, visualizing how the K1 game’s actions in a volleyball match are spatially interrelated. Additionally, it’s the first app to allow real-time calculation of **attack zone transition probabilities** and post-match **multiple correspondence analysis (MCA)** for volleyball data.

- **<img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios-filled/24/000000/stopwatch.png"/> Enhanced real-time interactivity**: Develop further real-time features to increase usability and responsiveness for users.
