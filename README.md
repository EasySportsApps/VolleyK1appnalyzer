## 📝 About VolleyK1@ppnalyzer

VolleyK1@ppnalyzer is a free, interactive web application developed with R Studio and Shiny. This innovative tool is designed to analyze the **complex 1 or side-out phase (K1) in volleyball matches** 🏐, either in person or remotely via YouTube videos 📹.

VolleyK1@ppnalyzer is the world’s first application 🌍 that enables real-time construction of **social network graphs** 👥, visualizing how the K1 game’s actions in a volleyball match are spatially interrelated. Additionally, it’s the first app to allow real-time calculation of **attack zone transition probabilities** 🔄 and post-match **multiple correspondence analysis (MCA)** 📊 for volleyball data.
