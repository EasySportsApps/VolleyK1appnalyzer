VolleyK1@ppnalyzer is a free, interactive web application developed with R Studio and Shiny. This innovative tool is designed to analyze the **complex 1 or side-out phase (K1) in volleyball matches**, either in person or remotely via YouTube videos.

VolleyK1@ppnalyzer is the world’s first application that enables real-time construction of **social network graphs**, visualizing how the K1 game’s actions in a volleyball match are spatially interrelated. Additionally, it’s the first app to allow real-time calculation of **attack zone transition probabilities** and post-match **multiple correspondence analysis (MCA)** for volleyball data.

- **<img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios-filled/24/000000/stopwatch.png"/> Enhanced real-Time interactivity**: develop further real-time features to increase usability and responsiveness for users.
